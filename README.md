# Chatbot H I R O

# Introduction
What is a ChatBot? A computer program designed to simulate conversations with human users, over some platform. This project is based on the concept of a basic ChatBot which works for the FAST Admission           FAQ Portal. It helps its users to access all the necessary information regarding the Admission procedures.

# Data structures & Technologies used
    AVL Trees were used to make ChatBot H I R O work. The project majorly focuses on the concept of Deep Learning. Further technologies used:
        - Language used: C++
        - IDEs used: Visual Studio 2019
        - Speech Development

# Problem Analysis
As accessing specific information about any Admission related process is difficult, the chatbot technology will be useful in such scenarios. The program stores all the possible queries in a systematic manner (using AVL Trees), and produces a response for that specific query. It also stores the unknown responses for any new queries and responses accordingly (Deep Learning Concept).

# Future Work
Despite the numerous amounts of code optimization we performed, we couldâ€™ve improved the program further in various places. Several other features can be added in the future, for example, making the bot open to queries regarding various categories such as the faculty department, other campus details, services and career opportunities.

# Conclusion
The mentioned project is based on the data structures-AVL Trees. It is capable of handling unknown queries of its users by using the concept of Deep Learning and Filing. The program follows the Object-Oriented approach. The user is welcomed to a user friendly environment which has been designed to help its users completely.
